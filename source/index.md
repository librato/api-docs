# Introduction

Welcome to the official reference for Librato's
Application Programming Interface (API).

Librato is committed to enabling our
user community to manage their services configurations
through first-class REST APIs. Librato's own
clients (web, command line, etc) are built upon these APIs.

Detailed documentation for authentication and each individual API call can
be accessed through the menu. We invite suggestions, feature
requests or problem reports at
[our support forum](http://support.metrics.librato.com).
