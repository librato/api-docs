# Annotations
## Overview

Annotations are used to record external events (e.g. a deployment) that typically occur at non-uniform times, yet may impact the behavior of monitored metrics. Each annotation event has an associated time and metadata description. When a set of annotation events are added to a graph, each event is plotted as a single vertical line. This permits a user to correlate operational or business actions to observed metrics.

Every annotation event is associated with a single named annotation stream, analogous to how multiple measurements are associated with the named metric they belong to. For example, you might have an annotation stream named ux-app-deploys to track deployments to your UX application and another annotation stream api-app-deploys to track deploys to your API application. Multiple annotation events can be added to a graph by selecting the name of the annotation stream, similar to selecting a metric name.

An annotation event can also include an end time to represent an event that spanned a duration of time. For example, a batch job that ran for five minutes would set the annotation event's start time when the job started and update the annotation event with an end time when the job completed. Annotation events that include an end time will be displayed with their start and end times as connected vertical lines on graphs.

### Annotation Streams

Annotation streams group related annotation events into a single timeline. Annotation streams are referenced by their name and are automatically created when an annotation event is POSTed to a new annotation stream name.

Annotation streams have the following properties:

Annotation Property | Definition
------------------- | ----------
name | Name of the annotation stream.
display_name | The string used to display this annotation stream.

### Annotation Events

An annotation event records a single point in time when an external action (like a deployment) occurred. Annotation events can include metadata that describe the particular event in more detail or reference an external site.

Annotation events have the following properties:

Annotation Property | Definition
------------------- | ----------
id | Each annotation event has a unique numeric ID.
title | The title of an annotation is a string and may contain spaces. The title should be a short, high-level summary of the annotation e.g. `v45 Deployment`. The title is a required parameter to create an annotation.
source | A string which describes the originating source of an annotation when that annotation is tracked across multiple members of a population. Examples: foo3.bar.com, user-123, 77025.
description | The description contains extra metadata about a particular annotation. The description should contain specifics on the individual annotation e.g. `Deployed 9b562b2: shipped new feature foo!` A description is not required to create an annotation.
links | An optional list of references to resources associated with the particular annotation. For example, these links could point to a build page in a CI system or a changeset description of an SCM. Each link has a tag that defines the link's relationship to the annotation. See the [link documentation](#add-link-to-annotation-event) for details on available parameters.
start_time | The [unix timestamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) indicating the the time at which the event referenced by this annotation started. By default this is set to the current time if not specified.
end_time | The [unix timestamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) indicating the the time at which the event referenced by this annotation ended. For events that have a duration, this is a useful way to annotate the duration of the event. This parameter is optional and defaults to null if not set.

### Pagination Parameters

The response is paginated, so the request supports our generic [Pagination Parameters](#pagination). Specific to annotation streams, the default value of the `orderby` pagination parameter is `name`, and the permissible values of the `orderby` pagination parameter are: `name`.

}
```

Return a list of annotations associated with given stream name.

### Annotation Search Parameters

If optional [time interval search parameters](#time-intervals) are specified, the response includes the set of annotation events with start times that are covered by the time interval. Annotation events are always returned in order by their start times.

Annotation events are grouped by their originating source name if one was specified when the annotation event was created. All annotation events that were created without an explicit source name are listed with the source name `unassigned`.

Annotation events can be further restricted by the following search parameters:

Search Parameter | Definition
---------------- | ----------
sources | An array of source names to limit the search to. Can include source name wildcards like `db-*` to show annotations from all db sources.

`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

For JSON:

`Content-Type: application/json`

Parameter | Definition
--------- | ----------
title | The title of an annotation is a string and may contain spaces. The title should be a short, high-level summary of the annotation e.g. `v45 Deployment`. The title is a required parameter to create an annotation.
source<br>`optional` | A string which describes the originating source of an annotation when that annotation is tracked across multiple members of a population. Examples: foo3.bar.com, user-123, 77025.
description<br>`optional` | The description contains extra metadata about a particular annotation. The description should contain specifics on the individual annotation e.g. `Deployed 9b562b2: shipped new feature foo!` A description is not required to create an annotation.
links<br>`optional` | An optional list of references to resources associated with the particular annotation. For example, these links could point to a build page in a CI system or a changeset description of an SCM. Each link has a tag that defines the link's relationship to the annotation.
