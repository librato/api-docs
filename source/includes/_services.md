# Services

## Overview

Services define the actions that are taken when an alert is triggered. Example actions might include: sending an email, notifying a real-time chat room, or hitting an external web hook with a POST.

A single service can be shared across multiple alerts. This allows for a single service to be configured and reused on multiple alerts without having to copy the service details. Similarly, a single alert can notify multiple services of the same type. For example, a single alert could notify multiple real-time chat rooms.

Each service is chosen from a set of supported back end services. The supported services are implemented in the [Librato Services](https://github.com/librato/librato-services) Github repository. Users are encouraged to contribute new services.
