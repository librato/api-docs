# Services

Services define the actions that are taken when an alert is triggered. Example actions might include: sending an email, notifying a real-time chat room, or hitting an external web hook with a POST.

A single service can be shared across multiple alerts. This allows for a single service to be configured and reused on multiple alerts without having to copy the service details. Similarly, a single alert can notify multiple services of the same type. For example, a single alert could notify multiple real-time chat rooms.

Each service is chosen from a set of supported back end services. The supported services are implemented in the [Librato Services](https://www.librato.com/docs/kb/alert/alerts-intro.html#notification-services) Github repository. Users are encouraged to contribute new services.

#### Service Properties

Property | Definition
-------- | ----------
id | Each service has a unique numeric ID.
type | The service type (e.g. Campfire, Pagerduty, mail, etc.). See an extensive list of [services here](https://www.librato.com/docs/kb/alert/alerts-intro.html#notification-services).
settings | Hash of settings specific to the service type.
title | Display title for the service.

#### Pagination Parameters

The response is paginated, so the request supports our generic [Pagination Parameters](#pagination5). Specific to services, the default value of the `orderby` pagination parameter is `title`, and the permissible values of the `orderby` pagination parameter are: `title` and `updated_at`.
